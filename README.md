# PocketNurse
Pocket Nurse is a Terraria(1.4.3.6) mod that adds a new PostMech accessory that allows you to heal using hotkey(default is 'h', but you can edit it in game) for price of   silver per hp.
It will also grant you some buffs for short amount of time.
You can craft it at Mythril (or Orichalcum) Anvil with:
